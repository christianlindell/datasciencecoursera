## Summary statistics from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0


The aim of the r script run_analysis.R is to produce summary statistics from the dataset Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones” that can be downloaded 

from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 

To run the script the data set must be downloaded and unzipt and placed in the same directory as run_analysis.R. The unzipt data set should be in the 

directory “UCI HAR Dataset”. You will find detailed information of the full dataset in the ”README.txt” and the ”features_info.txt” in the directory ”UCI HAR 

Dataset”.

The script produce a tab separated text file named “signaldata_mean.txt” that is saved in the active directory.

## Study design


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 

WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer 

and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to 

label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 

training data and 30% the test data.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 

(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 

filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 

(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also 

the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 

tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 

fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

## Codebook

The above mentioned signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals included : 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
ad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

### Units

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X/Y/Z axis in standard gravity units 'g
The unit for the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each sample are radians/second.
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

Content in the aggregated data set produced by the r script run_analysis.R.

In the full data set the data are divided into one training set and one test set. In the aggregated file produced by script run_analysis.R the both set are 

merged into one table.

For each of the above mentioned variables in the original full dataset the run_analysis.R scipt selects only the variables that contain the word “mean” or 

“stdv”. That means that from the original 561 variables 86 are selected.

Every subject has conducted the tests several times, producing several values for each combination of subject and activity. The aggregated table contains the 

mean for all specific variables divided by activity and subject. 

The variables names has been changed according to naming conventions used in R:
All variable names are in lower cases.
Parenthesis, underscore and hyphens have been deleted.

This mean that a variable name like “tBodyAcc-mean()-Z” has been changed to “tbodyaccmeanz”.

The aggregated data set contains the following variable names:
